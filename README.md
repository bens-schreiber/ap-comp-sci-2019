Created my sophomore year of highschool for an AP project.
Implements its own mathematics based on set theory, IE using a list of size N to dictate the integer N, and then creates
operators to manipulate the set, such as addition (appending to the list), subtraction (popping from the list), multiplication, divison and so on.
